Hello there,

The project in this folder contains the implementation for *Material Reader* project part of the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

With the provided starter code ([XYZ Reader](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code)), this project provides an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.
